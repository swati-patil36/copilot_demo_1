Copilot Demo 1
This repository demonstrates my experience using GitHub Copilot to generate a Python script that prints the system uptime.

Experience Using Copilot
Code Generated by Copilot:
I asked Copilot to generate a Python script (copilot_test.py) that prints the system uptime. Copilot provided a cross-platform script that reads uptime from /proc/uptime on Unix-like systems and uses Windows API for Windows.

Modifications Made:
I reviewed the generated code and found it accurate for my use case. No significant modifications were necessary, as Copilotâ€™s script handled both Unix-like and Windows environments gracefully.

Testing the Script:
I tested the script on my system by running:

Code
python copilot_test.py
The output showed the uptime in seconds as expected.

How to Run the Script
Clone this repository:

sh
git clone https://github.com/swati-patil36/copilot_demo_1.git
cd copilot_demo_1
Run the script:

sh
python copilot_test.py
You should see the system uptime (in seconds) printed to your terminal.
